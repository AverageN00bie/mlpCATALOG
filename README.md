HI! This project was made in python 3.10.12, so you're probably gonna need the interpreter for that. 
To execute it, you'll need to have all the pictures saved on the directory, and then just run it! If any errors occur, try messaging me or something, my discord is average_n00bie :D. 
By the way, the code saves the ASCII text in a file on the directory it's placed on.
